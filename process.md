The 3 steps for managing files with git is to do (git init) to start the .git stuff. Once you modify the files and save them you have to git add (filename) or (.) if you want to add everything. You can see where you are at within the git by typing git status. After you are sure you want to commit everything just type in git commit -m'(leave a message here'. That is the process on how to manage your files in git.
